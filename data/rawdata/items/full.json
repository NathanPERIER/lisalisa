As a result, this fish sells very well. At Sumeru's fish markets, you can often see signs that say: \"Do not keep Sunset Cloud Anglers in the same tank as other fish meant for consumption.\"",

Due to their hard scales and big size, Axe Marlins are able to handle attacks from other aquatic creatures, waiting until their attacker is exhausted and leaves.\nTheir strength can also prove challenging for a master fisherman, whose only choice is to treat them as large beasts \u2014 to drain their stamina more efficiently and eventually catch them, one must go all out the moment an Axe Marlin bites.",
