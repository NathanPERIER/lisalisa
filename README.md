# lisalisa

LisaLisa is a project that aims to gather Genshin Impact data and create a website that shows how many resources are required to progress in the game. For now, we are mainly focusing our attention on data gathering and formatting so there isn't much to see (except huge JSONs), but you can expect more web development in the upcoming months.

## Acknowledgements

This project was made possible by [Dimbreath](https://github.com/Dimbreath) and his project [`GenshinData`](https://github.com/Dimbreath/GenshinData), which is our main data source.

The [Honey Impact website](https://genshin.honeyhunterworld.com/?lang=EN) was also a huge help, as they already did an impressive job at gathering data. This is where we get most of our images from.

Finally, the [Genshin Impact Wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genshin_Impact_Wiki) provided useful information and some of the images.
